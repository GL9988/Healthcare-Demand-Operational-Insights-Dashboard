# 🥗  Customer Segmentation for Meal Kit Retention
Behavioral segmentation and predictive modeling to optimize churn strategy, menu bundling, and loyalty incentives.

---

## 💡 Business Motivation  
Blue Apron faced rising acquisition costs and high churn. Our objective was to identify valuable customer segments and redesign promotions to improve retention and long-term value.

---

## 📊 Data & Features  
Leveraged internal cohort data alongside regional and behavioral signals to define segmentation variables such as:

- Acquisition source & channel  
- Trial completion status  
- Purchase cadence & average order value (AOV)  
- Regional cuisine preferences  

These were used to derive customer lifetime value (CLV) insights and cluster users by risk profile and retention probability.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Methods  
- **Excel**: Cohort analysis, CLV simulation, and trial-to-churn funnel  
- **Tableau**: Dynamic KPI dashboards by cohort and campaign  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Behavioral segmentation to guide bundle offers  
- **Business Strategy**: Promotion redesign and cost-per-retained-user modeling

## 🚀 Results & Recommendations  
| Insight                            | Outcome                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| High-risk churn segments identified| Tailored messaging & region-based bundling recommended                  |
| Referral incentives not effective  | Replaced with menu-based loyalty tiers, projected to reduce churn by 8% |
| Bundling impact modeled            | Optimized trial menus projected to increase retention by 14%            |
| KPI dashboard rollout              | Enabled real-time monitoring of trial conversion and retention metrics  |

## 📌 Business Impact  
The proposed strategy is expected to:
- Reduce **customer acquisition cost** by 12%  
- Improve **first-order-to-subscription conversion** by 18%  
- Raise **customer lifetime value (CLV)** from $397 → $450 under the optimized model  

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- **Excel**: Data wrangling, retention curve modeling  
- **Tableau**: KPI dashboards by segment and funnel stage  
- **Predictive Logic**: Trial outcome forecasting using behavioral features  

---
